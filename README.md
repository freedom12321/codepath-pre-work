## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App: Spotify
Personalized Playlists: Spotify creates daily and weekly playlists tailored to my listening habits.
Discover: Helps me find new songs and artists based on my listening history.

App: Notion
Versatile Note-taking: Allows for rich-text, databases, kanban boards, and more all in one platform.
Templates: Ability to create and use templates for repetitive tasks or note structures.

App: Twitter
Customizable Feed: I can curate my feed based on who I follow, which gives me control over the content I consume.
Lists: Allows me to group and categorize accounts, making it easier to consume content based on my current interests.

App Idea:
App Name: BookBuddy

Description: BookBuddy is a social networking app designed specifically for book lovers. Users can create virtual bookshelves, share what they're currently reading, write reviews, and more. The app's main feature would be creating and joining book clubs. Users can create a book club for a specific book, invite friends or open it to the public, and set reading milestones. The app would have a built-in discussion forum for each club, allowing members to discuss chapters, share insights, and even schedule virtual or in-person meetups. Another feature would be a recommendation system that suggests books based on reading habits and preferences, drawing from both popular choices and hidden gems. The app aims to make reading more social and interactive, connecting book lovers from around the world.
